## What This Guide is About

This subject guide is a resource for **new lawyers and legal professionals** who are just starting out their research on civil and criminal liability in sports. The topic is primarily dedicated to **assaults and accidents within professional and amateaur sports games**. Given that athletes consent to a reasonable level of physical confrontation during sports games, at what point is consent no longer granted? When do sporting accidents indicate negligence? This guide provides resources to help answer these questions.
