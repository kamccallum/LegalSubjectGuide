### Key Cases

> *R. v. Jobidon*, 1991 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1991] 2 SCR 714, [https://canlii.ca/t/1fskj](https://canlii.ca/t/1fskj)

The accused and victim both consented to a fair fist fight which resulted in death and the accused charged with second degree murder. The Ontario Court of Appeal reversed the prior decision: consent to a fist fight is *not* a defence against a charge of assault, with some exceptions in the case of properly-conducted games and sports. The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed this ruling.

> "There is a lot of violence in sports like hockey and it is accepted because the athletes know going into each game that there will be violence and that they may be involved in a fight whether they like it or not. By playing the sport at this level, the athletes consent to 'some violence' because they know it is part of the game that they have contracted to play in. The same cannot be said for non-contact or recreational leagues. In these leagues there is no consent to the violence that regularly forms part of the sport at the professional or semi-professional level." (para. 26-27)

> *R. v. Miletic*, 2020 BCPC 154 (CanLII), [https://canlii.ca/t/j97jg](https://canlii.ca/t/j97jg)

> "I fail to see how the expectations of a higher level of violence in a professional league, or the physical training and preparation level of the athletes, decreases the need for denunciation and deterrence when the level of violence norms are exceeded, particularly when, if anything, general deterrence will be increased when the case has higher notoriety. That, in effect, says because the victim expects some level of violence, the offender is entitled to the benefit of that expectation even when the offender exceeds that level. Similarly, I fail to see how the lower expectations of violence in a non-professional league, even if true, should result in greater penalty to the offender." (para. 32)
