Plaintiff was a scorekeeper who suffered a head injury from a foul ball. She brought a claim against the defendant under the *Occupiers Liability Act*, as she would have been out of harm's way in the dugout if it hadn't been flooded. Plaintiff alleged that the defendent did not fulfill it's duty to provide a safe place for scorekeeping activities. The British Columbia Supreme Court ruled that the defendent did not breach standard of care, as the association had erected protective fencing.
